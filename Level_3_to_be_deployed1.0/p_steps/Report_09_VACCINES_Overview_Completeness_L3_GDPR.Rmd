The analysis contains the following steps:

<br>

![steps in analysis](images/vaccines_l3.png)

If subpopulations are available in your data the analysis will be performed separately for each subpopulation.
In case there is an overlapping subpopulation only subjects in the overlap period will be taken into account.
***Example:***

<br>

![subpopulations analysis](images/subpopulations.png)

`year` is retrieved from `vx_record_date` or `vx_admin_date`. If both dates are present, `vx_admin_date` will be used.
